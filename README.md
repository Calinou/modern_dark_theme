![Demo image](https://lut.im/6X2lfNGJ2k/4Q1GDspYUy4qqJOl.png)

A modern, dark, flat theme, intended for use in games.

In `theme/source`, you'll find an `export.sh` script which lets you export all
SVGs to PNGs. It requires Inkscape and OptiPNG to be installed and in the `PATH`
environment variable.
